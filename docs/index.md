# Jamplate Project

Jamplate Project is a general purpose compiler toolkit.

Its goal is to make lexical analysis easier to maintain
and read while supporting any feature a language might need.

It achieves that by adopting a plugin/component based system
where every grammar/rule has its own lexer that can work
independently of any other lexer.
